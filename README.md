The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players must repeat sequences of flashing lights and sounds in the correct order. With each round, the sequence becomes longer, challenging the player's ability to remember the correct order. This implementation of the Simon Game uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to recreate the experience in the browser.



Features:

Dynamic Visuals: The game uses CSS to create four colored buttons (red, green, blue, yellow) that flash in sequence.

Sound Effects: Each button plays a unique sound, providing both visual and audio cues.

Interactive Gameplay: Players must click the buttons in the correct order, matching the sequence generated by the game.

Progressive Difficulty: Each round adds a new step to the sequence, making the game increasingly challenging.

How to Play:
Start the game by pressing any key on the keypad.

Watch the sequence of flashing colors.

Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.

If you succeed, a new color will be added to the sequence. If you make a mistake, the game ends.
